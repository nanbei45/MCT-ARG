# MCT-ARG
we propose an innovative multi-channel Transformer-based framework for ARG prediction, termed MCT-ARG. By integrating protein sequence data, secondary structure information, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA) features, our approach overcomes the traditional reliance on single-sequence features, markedly improving both the accuracy of ARG identification and the resolution of functional site analysis. The model employs a multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies among multimodal features and incorporates a dual-constraint regularization strategy—comprising entropy minimization and local continuity constraints—to optimize the attention weight distribution and strengthen the detection of key functional sites.
